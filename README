README

this is the repository for fail2ban-p2p. Fail2ban-p2p is a standalone
application written in python that will exchange IPs of attackers detected
by fail2ban (http://www.fail2ban.org) using a p2p-network. 

Basic concept:

* Every node in the p2p-network is connected to at least one other 'friend'
* friends exchange their public keys to verify messages signed with the
  senders private key.
* Nodes send each other messages when one of them detected an attacker
* Nodes also pass along this information to spread it in the network
* You can assign different trustlevels for friends and a threshold that is
  required to ban an attacker locally.

Short coding styleguide:

- One class per file
- One directory per package
- One tab = 4 spaces
- lower-case variables, if it consists of multiple words, beginning of every
  new word is upper-case, e.g.:
  donauDampfSchiffFahrtsGesellschaft, protocolVersion, tmp
- the above is also true for function names
- class names behave similarly, except for the fact that they begin with a
  capital letter.
